# churn_modelling
Using python’s libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon is done.
In predicting considered various factors which affects prediction such as Balance, Credit score, Age, Active members, Salary etc.
With the help of resampling technique, Deep learning’s Tensorflow and Keras library and neural network cycle and machine learning metrics got following accuracy results:
(a)	F1-Score = 0.76
(b)	Precision =  0.75
(c)	Recall = 0.78
